1. why choose census 2011 data: 
    though it isn't recent, it is the only authoritative source with exhaustive data on indian women.
    in our project, we can do DA on this, leaving the future scope to doing the same thing with the census 2021 data
    as and when we get it. 
   
2. Read:  VaraibleNamesCensus2011 for an idea of the kind of variable names we have avaiable. The possibilities are huge! ;)
