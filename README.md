1. why choose census 2011 data: 
    though it isn't recent, it is the only authoritative source with exhaustive data on indian women.
    in our project, we can do DA on this, leaving the future scope to doing the same thing with the census 2021 data

2. Read:  VariableNamesCensus2011 for an idea of the kind of variable names we have available. The possibilities are huge! ;)

3. Read: CRISP-DM Process.txt
   contains the steps we need to follow when documenting our project
